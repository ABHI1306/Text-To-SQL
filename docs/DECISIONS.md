# Day 1 model selection notes

## Current status (2026-10-12)

Ran the 10-case schema-constrained prompt test against both installed, local-capable
generation models. The full comparative data is in
`reports/day1-model-bakeoff-20261012.json`.

| Model | Schema-valid | Expected tables present | Wall time | Digest |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `llama3:latest` | 9/10 | 10/10 | 67.76 s | `365c0bd3c000a25d28ddbf732fe1c6add414de7275464c4e4d1c3b5fcb5d8ad1` |
| `llava:latest` | 7/10 | 7/10 | 190.99 s | `8dd30f6b0cb19f555f2c7a7ebda861449ea2cc76bf1f44e262931f45fc81d081` |

`llama3:latest` is the provisional local development candidate based on this smoke
comparison; this is not a production/model-selection decision. One response misspelled
`ecommerce` as `eecommerce`. Schema adherence does not establish correct filters, joins,
aggregations, execution accuracy, or performance under the real agent. The separate
refreshed baseline is in `reports/day1-model-smoke-20261012.json`.

`gpt-oss:120b-cloud` is excluded because the product runtime must not send data to a
cloud service. The plan's Day 3 model decision should be made using the compiler path and
golden set when those exist.

## Hardware tier

The checked host has 8 logical CPUs and 18.8 GiB RAM. It exposes Intel Iris Xe integrated
graphics but no NVIDIA GPU or discrete GPU VRAM. This is below the document's Tier B
reference (12–16 GB GPU VRAM or Apple Silicon with 24–32 GB unified memory), and is
closest to Tier A for local model sizing; it is not a Tier B reference machine. The user
confirmed this is the target demo machine and accepted the Tier A-class limitation.

## Review checkpoint

The plan recommends naming a second reviewer for the platform/security track. No second
reviewer is currently available; the user confirmed “no one.” This remains an open
human checkpoint and should be revisited if a reviewer becomes available.

## Day 1 boundary

Execution accuracy is not a Day 1 exit gate. The plan establishes its baseline on Day 3
and measures the target through the compiler path later, so it cannot be honestly
reported until that pipeline and the golden set exist. The current repository does not
yet contain that path.

The remaining Day 1 human checkpoint is to name a second reviewer; none is currently
available.
